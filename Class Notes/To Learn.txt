To do
	different classes in the same package vs different package(difference in code)
	final classes
	look at narrowing and widening
	
Notes:
	Access Modifier - public, private, protected, default, "no modifier"
	the public static void main(String[] args) must be placed for the code to run. That can be the only method to be included in that class
	the class of the file name may be the access modifier of "no modifier" or public
	within the same file, additional classes must be the access modifier of "no modifier"
	every method within a class must have a main body aka must have opening and closing {}
		otherwise it is declared as an abstract method and the brackets is replaced with ;	
	within the class of the file name(the one with the main) u can include other funtions that can be called if the original class is initialized. Because of the static in main, those functions in the same class cant be called
